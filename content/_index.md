# Code is science!

## Premise

**Science is often computing:** Much of modern science involves code these days, in large part due to the amount of data available - it would be almost impossible to analyse without computational assistance.

**Science requires peer review:** One of the basic prerequisites for any published scientific results is that it be reviewed by peers, to ensure the research and conclusions are valid.

**Software contains errors:** We may try pretty hard to write software without bugs, but they definitely still happen - and errors can be hard to spot. The bug doesn't have to cause [catastrophic and obvious failure](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pogue-5-most-embarrassing-software-bugs-in-history/) - it could be silent but sneaky.

## Code == Science

If software is required to perform science, it stands to reason that errors in your software mean errors in your science.

## Possible Solution?

Scientific code needs to be peer reviewed, and ideally open source.

That's easier said than done. Getting there requires awareness, culture shift, and adherence to best practices.

### Looking to Contribute?

- Do you wish more code was open source? Have you wished in the past that a database of open source journals existed? [Share your story](https://goo.gl/forms/k3IBxlDgi97ZTJuf2)
- Add more journals to our [list](https://goo.gl/forms/Ak9WErbGVyeFioW33) Right now it's a google form, but hopefully we'll have the full site up and running soon!
