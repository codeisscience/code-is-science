All ideas are welcome, providing they meet [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines.

Feel free to do one or many of the following: 
- Star this repo and tell others about it. We'd love to reach >100! 
- Read [our manifesto](https://codeisscience.github.io/manifesto/) and comment on it or share it with others! 
- [Contact us](http://www.codeisscience.com/contact/) for further discussion about an idea or problem (email, tweet, github issue - all good!)
- [Pick up an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues). Ideally start by leaving a comment saying you're working on it so someone else doesn't pick it up as well! 
- Do you wish more code was open source? Have you wished in the past that a DB of open source journals existed? Share your story: https://goo.gl/forms/k3IBxlDgi97ZTJuf2 
- Add more journals to our list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oY5ak7VJa-qwJJeWA3829S-1akZaYtHuWPYpChBdW2o/edit#gid=1946180293 Right now it's a google form, but hopefully we'll have the full site up and running soon!

### You don't have to be a coder to participate. 
Design, documentation, and community outreach are important parts of any project.  

[Coding tasks](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acode-task)  
[Design tasks](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/labels/design%20task)

### Code Guidelines
We're in early stages of the project, so any reasonable choice of language that will run on a linux/mac machine will be considered. Javascript, Java, Clojurescript are preferred but if you would like to contribute using another language please propose it!

### What you'll get
Eternal gratitude, free stickers ([email me](mailto:yochannah@gmail.com) if you want stickers, especially if you've made a contribution :heart:), your avatar in our contributers page, and the eternal smug glow of having contributed to an open source project. <3



## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/code-is-science).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
